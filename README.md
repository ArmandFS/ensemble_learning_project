# ensemble_learning_project
This repository is one of my assignment in my Data Science Programme. It is a combination of implementing ensemble learning machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, bagging, random forests, and majority voting. I'll be utilizing pure python libraries with a few classifiers from Sci-kit learn's machine learning library.
